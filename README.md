# COPS 4 kindle

A dedicated COPS (Calibre OPDS)  css theme for kindle e-book readers.   
Should also work elegantly on other manufacturers e-book readers.

## Why / whatfor ?

I was struggling with unbrowse'able cops library using default COPS templates.   
The bootstrap theme made things even worse, as everything is completely unreadable on kindle readers.   
Since I haven't found in inetwebz any custom made template for COPS dedicated to ebook readers I had to roll up my own sleeves.

## Installation

Just copy the css file to `/templates/default/styles/` directory within your COPS installation.    
The theme will be available to choose on cops configuration page right away.   

## Compatibility

I could test this only on kindle voyage (gen.7) having 300ppi display.   
Any newer kindle generation shouldn't have problems with diplaying nicely ebook lists, thumbnails, descriptions and download links.
